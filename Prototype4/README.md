# Design process / MDM

Plan:
  - Codify main transversal experiences as HTML, CSS, JS web elements
  - Allow / permit full interactivity in game embed to represent certain key moments in the story/experience
  - Make use of textual and media elements simply to for the experience's narrative and pictorial elements? (see how to express meaning below with JQUERY)
  - Map forms to dialogue / what the NPCs will use to reply semi-intelligently?
  - Use CS ds/graph algs to play with HTML/CSS elements

The second design question to answer is, "How can I design a speculative/futuristic experience?"

# Ideas

- Materials for speculative CBT: Material CBT
  - Using 3D objects as concrete mental objects / way to visualize them
    - AND manipulate them in real time, making therapy more accessible or efficient?
  - Using 3D environments as "architectural mind layout", or emotion mapping
  - Using interactions to enkindle diary-making, re-arranging pieces (sliding, drag-n-drop) for behaviour components of therapy
  - Meta-game handling: Using the web companion to ask the player and reflect about the game directly? I.e., forms, simple player statistics, etc.
  - In-game database/character exposure system: The web companion pretends it's part of the game... The elements represent parts of characters' mind / thought. Can use to reveal character details / bio
  - Continuity between in-game and meta-game? Unlockables? Interactive fables?
  - Website storytelling?
    - Using grids/flexbox
      - Spatial metaphors: fragmented vs. orderly puzzle / mini-game, a
      young man struggling to understand himself in a relationship
        - It Began with You (on your way to meet her)
          - Start game by showing you holding hands with a lady, you go to the cine
            - "Experience/Emotion" human training
              - Start game by sitting
          - -1. Welcome to the Material Therapy VR (It's year 2080 and it's cine time)!
          - 0. Launch modal to quiz user: Which character's narrative mateiral CBT?
          - 0. Launch modal to quiz user: Have you ever felt very anxious, depressed or ... ?          
            - Adjust experience from Likert rating submitted
            - Then follow John's experience / travels / documentary into the speculative future CBT of tomorrow
            - Progressively asked to record impressions/ratings by following John's narrative

          - 1/ Show three 3D model objects to pick from, representing a part of CBT's triangle:
              - Book for cognition
                - Librarian Skyrim mini-game
                  - Organize thoughts in the right shelves
                  - Mad NPC randomly comes in to throw books around, shoot him down when he appears or bludgeon him with a hammer-book                  

              - Car for behaviour
                - Car game sequence in Unity
                  - Thoughts occur on the road
                    - Drive/brake/shift gears on your thoughts (regain control by driving)
                      - Avoid running into big fonts on the road: "SHE'S NOT THAT INTO ME" / pitfalls
                  - Yarn spinner text message UI
              - Letter for emotion

          - 2/ Shopping, Add to cart page:
            - Shop for ideas or things to say to him
            - Get overwhelmed by html links spawning everywhere...
            - Regain control by...

    - Embed small canvases/3D objects between paragraphs, headers, etc.
    - Use JQUERY to hide/toggle and express meaning through that interaction?
      - Deliberate asynchronous/delayed handling / between user inputs to simulate thinking/conversation/uncertainty/etc.
      - Fading => forgetting
      - Toggling => switching thought processes on/off
        - Hiding / revealing core beliefs or automatic thoughts
      - Sliding => Moving on (old core beliefs)
      - Custom / css animations => Animating beliefs, emotion, sensation, behaviour
      - Adding/removing classes => Changing identities, patterns, behaviours
      - Offsets => Distances to reach in a relationship
      - Storing data in elements =>
        - div
        - p
        - h1/...
        - a
        - article, aside, main, body... BODY PARTS?!
          - Website companion as "body parts" to play with
        - ul, ol, li => Competing thoughts/priorities TODO list mini-game?
        - Incline square divs using rotate in css to simulate grids
        - Absolute vs. relative offsets => meaning?
        - Flexbox parameters: Space around, space between => metaphors of relationship puzzles using these and add/remove classes?
        - React
      - Chapter 1, 2... html page links with small unity embeds


# TODO:

- Experiment with web-common ideas
