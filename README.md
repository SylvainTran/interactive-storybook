# Welcome :palm_tree::hibiscus:ðŸŒ·

Hello! This project is about what the future could be like. I'm developing a video game :construction: to show what I think ðŸ¤” ðŸ’¬. 

:building_construction: :bricks:
This project is being developed in the Summer of 2022, remotely.

The project officially started development on May 9th, 2022. :seedling:

## __About the project/statement__ :tada:	

After about 2 weeks of deliberation, I've found the theme. The theme is a very subspecific part of what I found interesting about CBT. ("Understanding this enough to move on" cost me two prototypes, or about 2 weeks and a half of work, though). The idea came in part by also wanting to experiment with the free form nature of web, 3D embeds and sketches, and the potential of React's reactivity. (And the true nature behind Tower Defense in general.)

And the sub theme is...__The Universal Moment In Nature When You Know You Have To Leave Your Parents__.
- The beauty of taking risks over safety in the home. I've always found this intriguing.
- This is a playable essay?

I guess the interesting part about it is the "adolescent storm" phase in which a similar process to CBT occurs. Organizing, filtering, pushing unwanted outcomes, overcoming self-doubt, all those are potentially "moral physics" kind of ideas that can be played around in a game. 

So my user is the young adolescent, and my uses cases can be defined more specifically now.
What does my user need, not want, though? And what is speculative about it?

Limitations: 
- Extremely limited resources/times to do this.
