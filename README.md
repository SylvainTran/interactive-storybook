# Welcome :palm_tree::hibiscus:🌷

Hello! This project is about what the future could be like. I'm developing a video game :construction: to show what I think 🤔 💬. 

:building_construction: :bricks:
This project is being developed in the Summer of 2022, remotely.

The project officially started development on May 9th, 2022. :seedling:


## __About the project__ :tada:	

**Sylvain:** I've decided to improve my accessibility skills! :manual_wheelchair:	

**Random person in the audience:** :heavy_exclamation_mark:Are you serious:grey_question::bangbang:	

**Sylvain:** I think so. But if you have to ask... I have to wonder about my *future*. :umbrella:	

**Random pigeon in the sky:** But how will you do it?

**Sylvain:** I'll borrow from the 9 old men. APPEAL. I NEED IT.

**Random pigeon in the sky:** ok dud, don't ever Give Up! :rage4:

## __About the Theme__ 🎊

It's not decided as of May 9th, 2022. It may be ABOUT Therapy and Education. Specifically CBT. 🚧:construction_worker:🚧

**Random person in the audience:** :heavy_exclamation_mark:WOW:grey_question::bangbang:	Are you an expert?

**Sylvain:** No. That's where the fun is, I guess. Hopefully nobody gets hurt. 🤷‍♂️
